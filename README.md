graphsom
===============

graphsom dumps provides visualizations for metrics collected using [folsom](https://github.com/boundary/folsom). Currently we support only [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) visualizations but we will be adding suppor for multiple back ends soon. 

Note: [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) is good, despite the
website being really ghetto. 

Status
------

* Support for folsom's gauge metrics
* Support other metric types and visualization backends coming very soon
