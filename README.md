graphsom
===============

graphsom dumps metrics collected the awesome [folsom](https://github.com/boundary/folsom) to
[graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/)

Note: [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) is good, despite the
website being really ghetto. 

Status
------

* Support for folsom's gauge metrics
* Rest coming very soon ...
